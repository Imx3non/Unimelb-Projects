<h4>Program Execution</h4>
Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation
and readability.<br>

<i>Deductions</i>
<p>Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>deduct all execution marks if program generates no output at all; otherwise, 
deduct marks for the following items:
