# COMP20008 Assignment 2
## 2021 Semester 1 - Group 65

This is a collection of python files and the CSVs used to create them. With this, we created the final represenations and visualisations used in our report.  
Filtered versions of the original datasets (all obtained from Aurin or the Environmental Protection Authority) are contained in the datasets folder.  
The .py files process them, and produce the modified CSVs used in the report and the graphs contained in the ./graphs folder.
